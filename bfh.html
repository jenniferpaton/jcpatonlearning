          <p>This was somewhat of a passion project for me; I'd been volunteering with Benjamin Franklin House for about a year before I came up with a project proposal for the Education team to redesign their digital Discovery Room offer - a series of quizzes and games based on a few objects from their handling collection. They'd just finished an HLF project which had added some amazing images designed by <a href="https://www.kremenadimitrova.com/">Kremena Dimitrova</a> to their schools offer, and it seemed like an excellent time to suggest bringing their digital offer in line with the new look. (Plus after a year facilitating the digital handling side I felt pretty confident in saying their previous program was acting as dated as it was beginning to look!)
          <br>
          <br>
          My proposal was to bring the look of their software in line with Kremena's images, enhance accessibility, and address a few issues we as end-users had noted with the existing software. As always things were never that simple! But working closely with the BFH team and the Education volunteers I think we managed to achieve our goals.

          <p>There were a few key issues we wanted to address when rethinking the Discovery Room games,<br>
           <ul>
                   <li>Accessibity - fonts and text sizes, colour contrasts</li>
                   <li>Function - a few of the games just didn't work, or didn't work right for how they were being used, and missed a few opportunities.</li>
                   <li>Usability - both the volunteers leading the sessions and the students participating found some of the UI and functioning of the games hostile, so we wanted to improve the user experience for both sides.</li>
                   <li>Accuracy - a few of the facts displayed during the games had unfortunately fallen prey to the "half-life of facts" and were looking a touch outdated, we wanted to address that and use some more interesting, but shelf-stable factoids.</li>
                   <li>Hardware - we wanted to address some hardware issues and ensure the longevity of the software.</li>
               </ul>
          <br>
        The first was probably the easiest, the new look for the education sessions, with bright bold colours and a collagey style lent itself really well to the development of a style for both the quiz and game sections of the software which employed bold asymmetrical text and high contrast colours, which paired with a pleasantly off white parchment background increased readability and streamlined to the look of the screen. 

        Though functionally there were a few elements in the previous software which had needed addressing for some time - volunteers would actively avoid some games because of the unintuitive and difficult to master way they worked - taking a careful look at how the games and quizzes functioned mechanically was actually part of a larger goal to improve the learning outcomes and running of the sessions.

        <br>
 		By introducing holding mechanics as part of the soft fail-state (Above left) in the quiz sections we were able to introduce object handling prompts to help students engage with the objects and to counter problems that had been noted by volunteers with students brute-forcing the quiz portions.

        The changes we made game to game varied, from small improvements like introducing a counter for the Ink Drop (Above centre) to major mechanical changes for the Bone sorting game (Above right), which introduced both in-game feedback and a second-chance mechanic which allows students to discuss and re-try their choices, rather than just receive and arbitrary Game Over with no feedback on their mistakes!
        <br>
        <br>
        Usability wise one of the key things I was keen to add was a "re-set to start" function, it was one thing I particularly noticed as a volunteer and had commented on with others, that with limited time to run our sessions we were often left with half-finished games running when students moved on, or had students who had started the wrong game of the object they were handling in the middle of a session, with no way to exit or restart them but play through - we had all become pro-level speedrunners on our little set of levels. Because of this as one of the usability changes, I included a secret reset gesture which would return the game to the home screen.

        Hardware was perhaps the most challenging part of the project (as always) with compatibility and stability issues galore, but through working closely with BHF and their IT support, we were able to slog out a solution. Changing from developing the game for PC to creating an Android app, which would work stably with tablets the House already had and would have the flexibility to upgrade, both OS and device wise, if the hardware situation was to develop further down the line. This kind of futureproofing was a vital aspect of the project.
